# GGR472 Lab 4: Incorporating GIS analysis into web maps using Turf.js
 
In this lab I learned how to create a hexgrid, summarizing counts from a geojson containing points.
I learned about styling hexgrids, using expressions to change the symbology of layers in mapbox, and using 
turf to manipulate geojson files for greater data functionality. I am having issues with my laptop offloading downloaded files to icloud, which changes the file type and disrupts their use in the repository. Because of that, I left the data link as the link to the original repository that I cloned. 


## Repository Contents
- `data/pedcyc_collision_06-21.geojson`: Data file containing point locations of road collisions involving pedestrian and cyclists between 2006 and 2021 in Toronto 
- `index.html`: HTML file to render the map
- `style.css`: CSS file for positioning the map interface
- `script.js`: JavaScript file template to be updated to include code that creates and visualizes and hexgrid map based on the collision data
